You will need it for more DPS.\nI take Flame Shield for AoC setup because I have the Armor to get hit quite often and not die. It does 100M damage back to attackers with my Mastery boosts. I‚Äôve found out it‚Äôs the best thing to put points into.\nAs always, go do your own tests with what you have for gear. I‚Äôm not someone to follow mastery for mastery.',
